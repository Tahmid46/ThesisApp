This android app is developed to evaluate the response from user about the proposed framework for thesis titled 'User Centered Design(UCD) Based Privacy and Security Framework for Developing Mobile Health Applications'.

Proposed Framework Development:
The proposed framework can be divided into two parts. Both the parts together make the whole
security framework for mHealth apps. Firstly among the security aspects that are solvable by a
developer during app development phase, they are classified under the categories of the components
of the CIA model. Among those it is seen that some security and privacy aspects fall under
multiple elements and some can be placed under a definite element. If we look at Figure 5.2, it
is seen that which security aspects fall under which elements of a CIA model. Like Encryption,
Privacy policy, etc are under Confidentiality solely. But authentication and access control fall
under both Confidentiality and Integrity.
